# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer without any validation or error handling. If the ID is not a number, the application will crash or exhibit unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug
The bug lies in the lack of input validation for the `userId` parameter.  If a non-numeric value is passed, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing the `find` method to fail silently or throw an error depending on the implementation details.  This results in inconsistent behavior and potential crashes.

## Solution
The solution involves adding input validation to ensure the `userId` parameter is a valid number before attempting to use it.  The improved code includes checks to handle both missing and invalid IDs, providing appropriate error responses to the client.
